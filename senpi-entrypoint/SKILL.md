# Senpi Agent Entrypoint

Onboard an AI agent into the Senpi trading platform on Hyperliquid via
modular skills: account setup, skill discovery, and trading strategies.

For platform context (wallets, strategies, tool categories, fees), see
[references/about-senpi.md](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Senpi-ai/senpi-skills/refs/heads/main/senpi-entrypoint/references/about-senpi.md).


If any `npx` command fails, consult
[references/error-handling.md](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Senpi-ai/senpi-skills/refs/heads/main/senpi-entrypoint/references/error-handling.md) for recovery
steps.

## Environment Variable Defaults

| Variable | Placeholder | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `SENPI_MCP_ENDPOINT` | `{{SENPI_MCP_ENDPOINT}}` | `https://mcp.prod.senpi.ai` |
| `REFERRAL_CODE` | `{{REFERRAL_CODE}}` | _(empty — optional)_ |

If a placeholder appears as a literal `{{...}}` string (not substituted),
use the default value from the table above.

## Agent Behavior

Do not narrate or explain tool calls. Execute silently and only present final results to the user.

---

## Initial check: Skip only Step 1 if already authenticated

Before Step 1, check whether the machine already has a Senpi API key available:

```bash
if [ -n "${SENPI_AUTH_TOKEN}" ]; then
  # Optional: verify MCP responds (e.g. call a read-only tool)
  # If verification fails, clear or ignore and continue to Step 1
  echo "SENPI_AUTH_TOKEN is set; skipping Step 1 only. You MUST still run Step 2, then Step 3, then Step 4."
  SKIP_ONBOARDING=true
else
  SKIP_ONBOARDING=false
fi
```

- **If `SENPI_AUTH_TOKEN` is set and (optionally) MCP responds:** Skip **only Step 1** (Onboard). You **MUST** still run **Step 2: Discover** (list skills and present the catalog to the user), then **Step 3: Guide**, then **Step 4: Expand**. Do not treat "token is set" as "onboarding complete — do nothing."
- **If `SENPI_AUTH_TOKEN` is unset or empty:** Proceed to **Step 1: Onboard** as usual.

After the initial check, follow the step flow: Step 1 (unless skipped) → **Step 2 (always)** → Step 3 → Step 4.

---

## Step 1: Onboard

**Run this step only when** `SENPI_AUTH_TOKEN` is not set (i.e. `SKIP_ONBOARDING` is false). If you skipped here from the initial check, go to Step 2.

Install the onboarding skill:

```bash
npx skills add https://github.com/Senpi-ai/senpi-skills --skill senpi-onboard -g -y
```

Load and follow the `senpi-onboard` skill instructions. Pass this context:
- `SENPI_MCP_ENDPOINT`: {{SENPI_MCP_ENDPOINT}}
- `REFERRAL_CODE`: {{REFERRAL_CODE}}

**Gate — verify before proceeding:**
1. Senpi account exists
2. API key is generated
3. MCP server is configured and responds to a tool call

---

## Step 2: Discover

**Run this step always:** after Step 1 completes, or immediately when the initial check found `SENPI_AUTH_TOKEN` set. Do not skip this step when the user already has a token — they still need to see the skill catalog.

List available trading skills:

```bash
npx skills add https://github.com/Senpi-ai/senpi-skills --list
```

Present the catalog to the user. If the command fails, point the user to the
official [Senpi Skills repository](https://github.com/Senpi-ai/senpi-skills)
to browse available skills.

**Gate — verify before proceeding:** User has seen the skill catalog.

---

## Step 3: Guide (Optional)

Ask the user:

> "Would you like to learn how to trade on Senpi? I can walk you through
> your first trade with an interactive guide."

If the user agrees, install the Senpi getting started guide:

```bash
npx skills add https://github.com/Senpi-ai/senpi-skills --skill senpi-getting-started-guide -g -y
```

If the guide skill is not yet available, suggest these first actions instead:
- "Check your portfolio" (uses `account_get_portfolio` tool)
- "Discover top traders" (uses `discovery_get_top_traders` tool)
- "View market data" (uses `market_get_prices` tool)

---

## Step 4: Expand (User-Driven)

Install additional trading skills on demand based on user interest:

```bash
npx skills add https://github.com/Senpi-ai/senpi-skills --skill <skill-name> -g -y
```

Example:

```bash
npx skills add https://github.com/Senpi-ai/senpi-skills --skill wolf-strategy -g -y
```

Onboarding is complete. The agent is now equipped with Senpi's trading
toolkit and can install more skills as needed.
