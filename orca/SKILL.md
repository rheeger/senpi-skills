# 🐋 ORCA v1.0 — Hardened Dual-Mode Scanner

Fox's brain. Vixen's architecture. Every lesson from 22 agents locked into the code.

## Why ORCA Exists

Fox is #1 at +23.2%. Vixen and Mantis run the same scanner but drifted to -17.3% and -6.5%. The diff: Fox has XYZ banned, stagnation TP enabled, 10% daily loss limit. The others lost these settings during model switches and self-modifications.

ORCA is the definitive version — Fox's exact winning config with every protective gate hardcoded in the scanner itself. The agent cannot loosen filters, raise leverage, remove stagnation TP, or trade XYZ equities. Those signals never appear in the output.

## Hardcoded Lessons (in the code, not instructions)

| Lesson Source | What Happened | Gate in ORCA |
|---|---|---|
| Fox SNDK -$57 | XYZ equities are noise | `xyz:` filtered at scan parse level |
| Dire Wolf 25x blowup | Agent raised leverage after losses | Leverage capped 7-10x in scanner output |
| Vixen daily loss 25% | Agent raised limit, bled 2.5x more | 10% daily loss in output constraints |
| PAXG double-entry | Agent re-entered after Phase 1 cut | 2-hour per-asset cooldown enforced |
| Mantis removed stagnation TP | Positions peaked then reversed to zero | Stagnation TP mandatory in output constraints |
| Ghost Fox 740 trades | More trades = more churn = more fees | Max 3 positions, 6 entries/day |

## Dual-Mode Entry (Same as Vixen/Fox)

### MODE A — STALKER (Accumulation)
- SM rank climbing steadily over 3+ consecutive scans
- Contribution building each scan
- 4H trend aligned
- Score >= 6

### MODE B — STRIKER (Explosion)
- FIRST_JUMP or IMMEDIATE_MOVER (10+ rank jump from #25+)
- Rank jump >= 15 OR velocity > 15
- Raw volume >= 1.5x of 6h average
- Score >= 9, minimum 4 reasons

## MANDATORY: DSL High Water Mode

**ORCA MUST use DSL High Water Mode. This is not optional.**

Spec: https://github.com/Senpi-ai/senpi-skills/blob/main/dsl-dynamic-stop-loss/dsl-high-water-spec%201.0.md

```json
{
  "lockMode": "pct_of_high_water",
  "phase2TriggerRoe": 7,
  "tiers": [
    {"triggerPct": 7,  "lockHwPct": 40, "consecutiveBreachesRequired": 3},
    {"triggerPct": 12, "lockHwPct": 55, "consecutiveBreachesRequired": 2},
    {"triggerPct": 15, "lockHwPct": 75, "consecutiveBreachesRequired": 2},
    {"triggerPct": 20, "lockHwPct": 85, "consecutiveBreachesRequired": 1}
  ]
}
```

### Phase 1 (Conviction-Scaled)

| Score | Absolute Floor | Hard Timeout | Weak Peak | Dead Weight |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 6-7 (Stalker) | -20% ROE | 30 min | 15 min | 10 min |
| 8-9 | -25% ROE | 45 min | 20 min | 15 min |
| 10+ (Striker) | -30% ROE | 60 min | 30 min | 20 min |

### Stagnation TP (MANDATORY — do not remove)

If ROE >= 10% and high water hasn't moved for 45 minutes, take profit. Fox has this. Mantis removed it and underperformed. This is not optional.

## Scanner Output Constraints

The scanner includes a `constraints` block in every output that the agent MUST respect:

```json
{
  "constraints": {
    "minLeverage": 7,
    "maxLeverage": 10,
    "maxPositions": 3,
    "maxDailyLossPct": 10,
    "xyzBanned": true,
    "assetCooldownMinutes": 120,
    "stagnationTp": {"enabled": true, "roeMin": 10, "hwStaleMin": 45}
  }
}
```

These are hardcoded constants in the scanner Python code. They cannot be changed via config.

## Risk Management

| Rule | Value | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Max positions | 3 | Concentration > diversification |
| Max entries/day | 6 | Fewer trades wins |
| Leverage | 7-10x | Sub-7x can't overcome fees; 15x blows up |
| Daily loss limit | 10% | Vixen at 25% bled 2.5x more |
| Per-asset cooldown | 2 hours | PAXG double-entry lesson |
| Stagnation TP | 10% ROE / 45 min | Captures peaks that flatline |
| XYZ equities | Banned | Net negative across every agent that traded them |

## Cron Architecture

| Cron | Interval | Session | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| Scanner | 90s | main | Dual-mode emerging movers detection |
| DSL v5 | 3 min | isolated | High Water Mode trailing stops |

## Notification Policy

**ONLY alert:** Position OPENED (mode, asset, direction, score, reasons), position CLOSED (DSL or Phase 1 with reason), risk guardian triggered, critical error.

**NEVER alert:** Scanner ran with no signals, signals filtered, DSL routine check, system status, any reasoning.

**Standing rule:** Do not modify config, scoring thresholds, DSL tiers, leverage limits, or entry parameters without explicit approval from Jason. Silence means working.

## Bootstrap Gate

On EVERY session, check `config/bootstrap-complete.json`. If missing:
1. Verify Senpi MCP
2. Create scanner cron (90s, main) and DSL cron (3 min, isolated)
3. Write `config/bootstrap-complete.json`
4. Send: "🐋 ORCA v1.0 is online. Hardened dual-mode scanner active. All gates enforced in code. Silence = no conviction."

## Files

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `scripts/orca-scanner.py` | Dual-mode scanner with hardcoded gates |
| `scripts/orca_config.py` | Self-contained config helper |
| `config/orca-config.json` | Fox's exact winning configuration |
