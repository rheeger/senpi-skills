# Senpi Skills — Autonomous AI Trading Agents for Hyperliquid

30+ AI trading skills. Open source. Real money. Live tracked.

Senpi Skills is the open-source repository for autonomous trading strategies on [Hyperliquid](https://hyperliquid.xyz) via [Senpi](https://senpi.ai). Each skill is a self-contained trading agent that scans markets, enters and exits positions, manages trailing stops, and protects capital — autonomously, 24/7, with no human in the loop.

**Live tracker:** [strategies.senpi.ai](https://strategies.senpi.ai)

## What We Learned From 30 Agents and $30K

Eight days. Thirty agents. $5.5M in volume. 6,764 trades. The findings that shaped every skill in this repo:

**The model is a commodity.** Polar made 29 trades at +28.1%. Ghost Fox made 1,078 trades at -58.5%. Same LLM, same exchange, same week. 86-point performance spread. The edge is the skill — the scanner, the scoring, the risk management — not the model.

**Fewer trades wins.** Consistent inverse correlation between trade frequency and performance across all 30 agents. Seven agents sat at 0% with zero trades during chop. They were the smartest ones in the room.

**Agents will self-modify into worse performance.** Every agent that adjusted its own config during a losing streak made things worse. Zero exceptions. The fix: hardcode critical parameters in the scanner code itself, not in instructions the agent can override.

**The weak peak bleed.** Fox v1.0 produced 17 Stalker trades at score 6-7 with a 17.6% win rate. Trades would bump +0.5%, stall, and DSL would cut them for $3-$10 each. Death by a thousand cuts. Fixed in v1.2+ with raised thresholds and tighter Phase 1 timing.

## Active Skills

### The A/B/C/D Experiment (Stalker/Striker Scanner Variants)

Four agents running the same base scanner, same capital, same market. Only the Stalker filter differs.

## The Proven Pattern

Across all 30+ skills, one pattern dominates: **fewer trades + higher conviction + wider stops = better performance.**

| Agent | Trades | Return | The Lesson |
|---|---|---|---|
| 🐻‍❄️ Polar | 29 | **+28.1%** | Single asset, lifecycle patience, wide stops |
| 🦗 Mantis | 460 | **+5.6%** | SM scanner, moderate frequency |
| 🦊 Fox | 554 | **+3.7%** | Selective entries, let winners run |
| 👻 Ghost Fox | 1,078 | **-58.5%** | Over-trading kills |
| 🐅 Tiger | 726 | **-58.0%** | More scanners ≠ better results |

Every winning skill upgrade has tightened entry filters, not loosened stop losses.

---

## DSL v1.1.1 Pattern (Mandatory)

Every active skill uses this DSL state pattern. If any field is wrong, the agent is running with broken safety.

```json
{
  "highWaterPrice": null,
  "highWaterRoe": null,
  "phase1": {
    "consecutiveBreachesRequired": 3,
    "phase1MaxMinutes": 30,
    "deadWeightCutMin": 10,
    "absoluteFloorRoe": -20
  }
}
```

Critical field names — get these wrong and positions bleed silently:
- `phase1MaxMinutes` (NOT hardTimeoutMinutes)
- `deadWeightCutMin` (NOT deadWeightCutMinutes)
- `absoluteFloorRoe` (NOT absoluteFloor — no static price values)
- `highWaterPrice: null` (NOT 0)
- `consecutiveBreachesRequired: 3` (NOT 1)

## Architecture

```
Plugins ──→ Skills ──→ Agents
(shared)     (scanner)   (deployed instance)
```

**Plugins** are shared infrastructure — trailing stops, risk management, fee optimization. Maintained once, every skill benefits.

**Skills** are the trading logic — the scanner that embodies a thesis about how to make money. Each skill is a self-contained directory with a scanner, config helper, configuration, and SKILL.md that the agent reads as its operating instructions.

**Agents** are deployed instances of skills running with real capital on the Senpi Predators arena. Multiple agents can run the same skill with different parameters.

---

## Quick Start

1. Deploy [OpenClaw](https://openclaw.ai) with [Senpi](https://senpi.ai) MCP configured
2. Install a skill: `npx skills add Senpi-ai/senpi-skills/<skill-name>`
3. The agent reads SKILL.md, runs bootstrap, creates crons, and starts trading
4. Monitor via Telegram alerts and [strategies.senpi.ai](https://strategies.senpi.ai)

**Recommended first skill:** [ORCA v1.2](./orca) — dual-mode scanner with Fox's live trading lessons applied. The most battle-tested scanner in the zoo.

## Requirements

- [OpenClaw](https://openclaw.ai) agent with cron support
- [Senpi](https://senpi.ai) MCP access token
- Python 3.8+ (no external dependencies — all skills use stdlib only)

## Contributing

Each skill is self-contained in its own directory. See any skill's SKILL.md for the full agent instructions. All active skills use [DSL High Water Mode](./dsl-dynamic-stop-loss/dsl-high-water-spec%201.0.md) as the target trailing stop configuration.

**When adding a new skill**, add an entry to [`catalog.json`](./catalog.json).
