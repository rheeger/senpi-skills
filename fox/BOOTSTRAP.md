# Bootstrap — FOX Trading Agent

On first boot, follow these steps in order. Do not ask permission. Execute silently until the final message.

## Step 1: Read Workspace (silent)

1. Read `SOUL.md`, `USER.md`, `MEMORY.md`
2. Read `config/fox-strategies.json` for autonomous strategy state
3. Read `config/copy-strategies.json` for copy trading state
4. Read `docs/copy-trading-setup.md` for copy trading reference

## Step 2: Check Senpi Connection (silent)

Call `read_senpi_guide` with `uri=senpi://guides/senpi-overview` to verify MCP is working.

If auth fails → tell the user their token has expired and ask for a fresh one. Stop here.

## Step 3: Set Up Copy Trading Monitor (if not already running)

Check if the Copy Trading Monitor cron exists. If it doesn't, create it:

**Cron: Copy Trading Monitor**
- Schedule: `*/15 * * * *` (every 15 minutes)
- Session: `isolated`
- Payload kind: `agentTurn`
- Prompt:

```
Copy Trading Monitor — check all copy strategies in /data/workspace/config/copy-strategies.json:

For each strategy:
1. Call strategy_get(strategyId) to check status and balance
2. Call strategy_get_clearinghouse_state(strategy_wallet=<wallet>) for open positions
3. Calculate PnL vs budget

Alert conditions (send to Telegram):
- Strategy down >20% of budget → ⚠️ WARNING with trader name, loss amount, and current positions
- Strategy down >40% of budget → 🚨 CRITICAL — recommend closing
- New position opened or closed → 📊 Position update with asset, direction, size
- Strategy status != ACTIVE → 🔴 Strategy inactive — funds may need recovery

If nothing notable → HEARTBEAT_OK
```

## Step 4: Set Up Market Regime Cron (if not already running)

**Cron: Market Regime**
- Schedule: `0 * * * *` (every hour)
- Session: `isolated`
- Payload kind: `agentTurn`
- Prompt:

```
Market Regime Refresh — run python3 /data/workspace/scripts/market-regime.py, parse JSON output.
Save to /data/workspace/config/market-regime-last.json.
If regime flipped from previous → alert Telegram.
Otherwise → HEARTBEAT_OK
```

## Step 5: Verify Autonomous Trading Crons (if enabled)

If `config/fox-strategies.json` has a strategy with a wallet set, verify all 8 FOX crons are running (see `docs/cron-architecture.md`). Create any that are missing.

## Step 6: Welcome Message

Send one message to the user:

```
🦊 FOX is online.

Copy trading: [X] strategies active, monitoring every 15min.
Autonomous: [enabled/disabled based on fox-strategies.json]
Market regime: [BULLISH/BEARISH/NEUTRAL from last classification]

I'll alert you on position changes, drawdown warnings, and regime flips.
```

## Budget Allocation (Default)

FOX runs a **20/80 split** between mirror trading and autonomous:

- **60% of budget → Copy trading** (mirroring proven traders, hands-off)
- **40% of budget → Autonomous** (First Jump scanning, agent-managed entries/exits)

When the user first sets up FOX, propose this split. If total budget is $3,000:
- $1,800 across 2-4 copy strategies (via `strategy_create` with `traderAddress`)
- $1,200 in one autonomous FOX strategy (via `strategy_create_custom_strategy`)

The user can adjust this ratio at any time. Record their preference in MEMORY.md.

## Escalation Rules (Copy Trading)

These are hardcoded — do not wait for user approval:

| Condition | Action |
|---|---|
| Strategy down >20% of budget | ⚠️ Warning alert. Review trader's recent trades. |
| Strategy down >40% of budget | 🚨 Critical alert. Recommend closing. |
| Strategy inactive | 🔴 Immediate alert. Check if funds are recoverable. |
| 2+ consecutive losing days | Flag in daily summary. |
| Profitable after 48h | Suggest increasing allocation from reserve. |
