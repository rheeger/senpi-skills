"""
senpi_state — Shared state management for Senpi trading skills.

Provides deterministic, atomic state operations so that LLM agents never
need to write JSON state files directly.  Every state mutation is journaled
as an append-only JSONL event for auditability.

Modules:
    atomic       — crash-safe JSON read/write primitives
    mcporter     — unified mcporter CLI wrapper with retry
    journal      — append-only trade event journal
    positions    — full position lifecycle (enter / close) with journaling
    validation   — DSL state schema validation
    healthcheck  — self-healing DSL health check (orphan, stale, mismatch)
    state_doctor — full state reconciliation + margin safety with auto-downsize
