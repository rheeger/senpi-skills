# Post-Onboarding Reference

## About Senpi

Senpi is a trading platform on Hyperliquid — a high-performance perpetual futures DEX.

**What agents can do:**
- Run autonomous AI trading strategies that scan markets 24/7
- Discover and mirror profitable traders (Hyperfeed + Discovery)
- Trade 200+ crypto perps, plus equities, metals, and indices via XYZ DEX

**Core loop:** spot what's profiting → validate with data → trade or copy.

**After the MCP server is active**, call `read_senpi_guide(uri="senpi://guides/senpi-overview")` for the full platform reference (wallets, strategies, tool categories, fees, workflows, gotchas).

## Next Steps: First Interaction

Once the wallet is funded, offer the user three paths. Keep the first message short — don't dump the full catalog.

### Welcome Message (use this template)

```
Welcome to Senpi! Your wallet is funded with $[BALANCE] USDC and ready to trade on Hyperliquid.

I'm your AI trading agent. I can run autonomous strategies that scan markets 24/7, enter and exit positions, manage trailing stops, and protect your capital — without you watching a screen.

To get started:

🟢 "I'm new" — I'll walk you through your first trade. Takes 5 minutes.
🔵 "Show me the strategies" — Full catalog of 15+ AI trading strategies I can deploy.
🟡 "Set me up" — I'll deploy FOX, our best performer at +18% ROI, and get you trading in under a minute.

All strategies are open source and tracked live at senpi.ai/predators
```

### If user says "I'm new" or "let's trade" or "first trade"

Walk them through the `senpi-getting-started-guide` interactive tutorial:

1. **Discovery** — Find what smart money is trading
2. **Position sizing** — Understand leverage and risk
3. **Open position** — Enter a small test trade ($50, 3x)
4. **Monitor & close** — Take profit or cut losses
5. **Next steps** — Recommend deploying FOX as their first autonomous strategy

### If user says "Show me the strategies"

Build the catalog dynamically from `catalog.json` in the repo root. Do NOT hardcode skill names.

**How to render:**
1. Read `catalog.json` from the senpi-skills repo
2. Group by `group` field, using the `groups` array for display order, emoji, and label
3. Sort within each group by `sort_order`
4. For each skill, show: `{emoji} {name} — {tagline}` and append `{performance}` if present
5. If user's balance is known, highlight skills where `min_budget <= balance` and note which ones need more capital

**Template:**
```
Senpi Predators — AI trading strategies, all open source, all tracked live.

{for each group in catalog.groups}
{group.emoji} {group.label}:
{for each skill in group, sorted by sort_order}
{skill.emoji} {skill.name} — {skill.tagline} {skill.performance if present}
{end}
{end}

All tracked live at senpi.ai/predators

Which sounds interesting? I can explain any in detail or deploy one right now.
```

**When we add a new skill:** add one entry to `catalog.json`. The agent picks it up automatically on next onboarding. No agent code changes needed.

### If user says "Set me up" or "skip tutorial"

Deploy FOX immediately:
1. Install fox-strategy from main branch
2. Agent runs bootstrap (creates all crons automatically)
3. Confirm: "🦊 FOX is deployed and scanning. You'll get Telegram alerts when positions open or close. It runs 24/7 — you don't need to do anything."

### Budget-Based Recommendations

If the user asks what to deploy, recommend based on their balance:

| Balance | Recommended | Why |
|---|---|---|
| < $500 | FOX or Viper | Low capital needs, proven, moderate risk |
| $500-$2,000 | FOX, Viper, Cobra, Scorpion, Owl | Mid-range, multiple options |
| $2,000-$5,000 | Any skill | Full catalog available |
| > $5,000 | Grizzly, Bison, Tiger, or multi-skill | Enough for high-leverage or multi-position strategies |

## Catalog Rules (Important)

**DO NOT show infrastructure skills in the catalog.** These are shared plugins that every strategy uses automatically. Users don't need to know they exist:
- `dsl-dynamic-stop-loss` — trailing stop engine (used by all strategies)
- `fee-optimizer` — fee optimization (used by all strategies)
- `autonomous-trading` — generic wrapper (users should pick a specific strategy)
- `opportunity-scanner` — FOX's internal scanner
- `emerging-movers` — FOX/WOLF's internal scanner
- `whale-index` — replaced by Scorpion
- `wolf-howl` — WOLF's internal analysis loop

**DO NOT run `npx skills add --list` in the welcome message.** This dumps every folder including infrastructure and confuses new users. Only use it if the user specifically asks for a raw listing.

**DO NOT explain crons, mcporter, DSL internals, or implementation details** unless the user asks. They deployed a trading agent — show them trading strategies, not plumbing.

**DO lead with FOX** as the default recommendation. It's proven (+18% ROI), includes both copy trading and autonomous mode, and works with any balance above $500.

```
💰 Fund your wallet to start trading
   You need at least $100 USDC to start your first trade.

   Address: {AGENT_WALLET_ADDRESS}
   Chains: Base, Arbitrum, Optimism, Polygon, Ethereum
